I was unable to do the XOR operator, but I did manage to do the difference operator.
What the difference operator does is it goes through a while loop of a copied head, 
which will the first set we given, until it equals head. It then goes through a similar 
while loop, but it.s the second set given. It will then compare the two values within 
both linked lists and determine if it goes through (Also i++ just determines if both their 
heads equal and if i equals 1 than delete head). If both values are not equal to each other 
than it stores each number into the given linked list, the difference of the two provided. 
Afterwards all it does is reset everything so it can continuously loop until completion.
